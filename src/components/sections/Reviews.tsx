Met so many amazing women here, the guys definitely will make you work your game however are incredibly respectful and know how to roll with smaller sized people. I love the place here. It's clean. It's fun. It's educational. Super excited to hit the mats here again. ðŸ¤ŽðŸ¥‹ðŸ¤¼"

    text: "I have 3 kids 4-8 years old enrolled. Great experience!!! Everyone has been very patient and disciplined with all 3. One of my kiddos has some issues following the rules in school and has some big feeling when losing, Ray has been incredible with how he's adapted his approach to develop those skills and reactions. All three kids have made incredible strides in their skill level, ability to deal with losing AND dis up line in general. Great experience!!! Thank you!!"

    text: 'I dropped in from out of town and trained at both the 7am class with Vic and the evening class with Josh and Ray. The gym is fantasticâ€”clean, welcoming, and focused. The instructors are incredible: knowledgeable, approachable, and no-nonsense. Just real, high-quality jiu jitsu with zero fluff. Could not recommend Clockwork BJJ on Broadway more highly.'

    text: "Joining Clockwork Jiu Jitsu has been the most transformative experience of my life. When I first moved to New York, I didn't know anyone and signed up here simply as a way to exercise and maybe meet a few people. What I found went far beyond that. The coaches are world-class teachers who create an environment that's both challenging and welcoming, and the training partners here are some of the most genuine, supportive people I've ever met. Through training at Clockwork, I've not only grown stronger and more confident, but I've also built friendships that I know will last a lifetime. It's rare to find a place in a big city that feels like family, but that's exactly what this gym is. Whether you're brand new to jiu jitsu or have years of experience, you'll feel at home here from day one. If you're looking for a place to train, learn, and be part of a truly special community, I can't recommend Clockwork enough."
