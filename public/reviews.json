      "comment": "A-Life change place for our son!!\n\nOur son has been training at Clock work BJJ academy for 7 years, and we truly couldn’t have asked for a better place for his growth—both on and off the mat. From day one, the coaches created a safe, disciplined, and inspiring environment where he felt welcomed and challenged. Over the years, we’ve watched him build confidence, focus, resilience, and respect—qualities that extend far beyond the dojo.\n\nThis isn’t just a martial arts gym—it’s a community. The instructors are not only world-class in skill, but also incredibly dedicated to mentoring kids in a way that shapes character. The facility is always clean, well-organized, and professional.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place that will support your child’s development for the long haul, this is it. After 7 amazing years, we can say with certainty—this academy has been one of the best decisions we’ve ever made for our son.",

In a city of millions where it’s often hard to build real connections, this gym stands out as a place where you’re welcomed like family from day one. The instructors are incredible – not only are they highly skilled, but they take the time to learn your name immediately and truly care about your progress, both on and off the mats.\n\nThe sense of community here is unmatched. Every class feels like training with friends, and the support from both the coaches and fellow students pushes you to grow as a fighter and as a person. Beyond the techniques and drills, I’ve made lifelong friendships and built genuine connections with people from all walks of life. If you’re looking for top-tier BJJ instruction in NYC and a community that feels like home, this is the place to be.",

Plenty of great sparring partners for all weight classes and belt levels, everyone here is super respectful, especially the instructors. As a woman, I’ve found great community here with everyone.

Head instructor Josh Griffiths has, as a result of his own outstanding moral character, cultivated a team of instructors all worth much more than the expert instruction they offer on the mats. It is for this reason that so many of Josh’s black belts go on to open schools of their own. Similarly, and for the same reason, multitudes of students who have trained at Clockwork Jiu Jitsu and move to a different state, make a point to take a trip back to New York to train again at the gym; I’ve seen it happen more often than I can count.\n\nUltimately, if you are interested in caring deeply about the people around you and the activity in which you are all collectively participating in, there can be no other place for you than Clockwork Jiu Jitsu.",

Clockwork has a perfect blend of culture, instruction, and competitive edge. You’ll meet amazing people from all walks of life while learning all the skills you need to become the best version of yourself. I can’t recommend this place highly enough. I formed lifelong friendships here and I’m so grateful for clockwork.",

From the moment I walked through the door, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by the staff. Their welcoming nature immediately put me at ease.\n\nThe instructors were incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to guide me through the basics, breaking down complex techniques into simple, understandable methods. They really made sure that I felt comfortable and confident in my practice, regardless of my skill level.\n\nWhat struck me most was the supportive atmosphere in the gym. Everyone was friendly and encouraging, creating an environment where I felt safe to partner up and participate in class. It’s clear that this gym fosters a strong sense of community, and I truly appreciated being a part of it.\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for a place to learn Jiu Jitsu, whether you\u0027re a beginner or experienced, this gym is a must-visit. I left every class feeling stronger and more knowledgeable, and I can\u0027t wait to return! Thank you to the entire team for such an amazing experience!",

      "comment": "For those of you not familiar with the martial art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, the cleanest definition that I can provide would be: \"The imposing of ones will over another through a series of techniques designed to manipulate your opponent in order to achieve said goal\"\n\nOk maybe that wasn\u0027t as clean as I thought... long story short you\u0027re grappling.\n\nThe experience of grappling is a great and rewarding experience. It will teach you more about yourself than you ever thought. In the modern day world of the over -hyped and false achievement, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is straight truth. No gimmicks, no hiding. You tap people or you get tapped end of story. The primary key is keeping track of how you got there regardless of the outcome \u0026 learning from it.\n\nAs someone who has been training in the art since 2009, I\u0027ve come to know what constitutes as a good Jiu Jitsu instructor, and ladies \u0026 gentlemen Josh Griffiths of Clockwork Jiu Jitsu is it.\n\nSensei Griffiths has created an environment at Clockwork that is one of best types that one could hope for both newbie or veteran. Here are some key highlights:\n\nSIMPLICITY\nSensei Griffith\u0027s philosophy is simple, \"Jiu Jitsu is Easy\", \u0026 with him it is. He takes the time to break down complex movements into efficient techniques that anyone can do.\n\nFrom a student perspective, understanding the \"Why\" over the \"What\" with respect to executing a technique was always a challenge for me in my early years of training, but since joining Clockwork in late 2011, my game has evolved to the point where I am really understanding the \"Why\", and for anyone training Jiu Jitsu, this is so crucial.\n\nCLEANLINESS\nI\u0027ll be frank, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is not for people that don\u0027t like to get sweaty. Period. With that said, Clockwork does an excellent job at maintaining a very clean environment free of the typical locker room funk.\n\nThey offer superb Gi(uniform) cleaning services, multiple showers in the men \u0026 women\u0027s locker rooms, and hire a cleaning crew to sanitize the dojo each night.\n\nEGO - FREE CULTURE\nAttitude is a reflection of Leadership, and the laid back culture perpetuated at Clockwork allows for everyone to enjoy an environment free of the meat head, wannabe MMA mentality that seems to populate in many dojos leading to unnecessary injuries.\n\nIn addition, Sensei Griffiths\u0027 easy going and humble nature really allow you to forget his extensive competition resume. The man is a student of the art and is willing to impart his knowledge at the drop of a hat. Add to that the fact that he spars with his students every night creates a whole new level of learning that most schools just don\u0027t offer.\n\nCONFIDENCE BUILDING\nOne of the benefits of training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is that once you get past initial learning curve, you start to gain a level of confidence which translates to everything else in your life.\n\nWhen you train at a great school like Clockwork, your confidence sky rockets while your body weight plummets ;)\n\nIn closing, if you\u0027re looking to get into Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, save yourself the time and headache of training anywhere else. Make your first and only stop Clockwork Jiu Jitsu.",

      "comment": "If you are looking for a safe, clean, and more importantly fun Brazilian Jui-Jitsu school then look no further than Clockwork BJJ!\n\nA few years back my tattoo artist told me about Clockwork BJJ and that I should give it a try. I have always been interested in martial arts and specifically Brazilian Jui-Jitsu. I enrolled into an introductory class and was hooked! Six years later I am happy and excited to train every chance I get! What makes me so excited to train at Clockwork?\n\nPERSONALIZATION\nFrom the moment I began training I always felt a personalization in each class. Though we would learn new techniques we were encouraged to try what felt right to us, and to ask as many questions as possible. Even after class Josh, Cisco, Russ and Seb would always stay after to answer questions and drill techniques until we had no other option but to get better!\n\nSAFTEY \u0026 CLEANLINESS\nI have the highest respect for my Clockwork students and have always felt they have the highest respect for me. Egos are left at the door and safety is strictly adhered to. In any martial art cleanliness is also connected with safety, the school is professionally cleaned every night.\n\nCOMRADERIE\nFrankly I feel that this is where Clockwork\u0027s star shines the brightest. At Clockwork you will meet a spectrum of people across New York City. Being around Actors, Business people, Artists and Musicians has allowed me to grow as a jujitsuka and as a person. My Mental, Physical and Professional health has dramatically increased and I attribute it to the influence of Clockwork BJJ.",

      "comment": "i spend about a month or two a year in New York and everytime im in town i go to Clockwork to train. its the best BJJ school for anyone who goes downtown to train at. its conveniently located a block north of houston on broadway. their space is a huge flat where you never feel crowded no matter how many people are in a class. its so big you could run laps in there.\n\nthe gym is immaculately clean 24/7. there are huge windows that can be opened to get good airflow in the summer. the changing rooms are large and clean white tile with 3 showers so you dont have to wait 30 min after class to get a shower. they probably have the most mat space by square foot of almost anywhere in NYC and the mats are high quality mats built for jiu jitsu.\n\nthe head instructor is josh griffiths, a second degree blackbelt under famed UFC fighter kennny florian. his accommplishments in the sport and tournament victories are too copious to list. most importantly he is a patient and approachable instructor who gives as much or more attention to new students as he does to those who have been there for years. theres no reason to be intimidated if youre a first timer. everyone is so friendly there its like youre a new member of the family.\n\njosh teaches the same lesson all week in the gi and no gi classes, so everyone gets it down pat by the end of the week. he\u0027s backed up by other quality instructors like cisco sebastian and russ who fill in if josh is outta town or for off hours classes. there are a number of other brown belts and a couple black belts who are there all the time to help with any questions anyone has. but josh himself teaches all the primetime classes so you get alot of face time with the head instructor, unlike alot of gyms where the main guy doesnt even know your name. if you have kids the kids classes are packed theyre so popular. its a great sport for kids and they have dedicated kids classes for the little ones.\n\nall the instructors and students are so friendly and supportive of each other. its like training with your friends. no body tries to dominate anyone smaller or less experienced than them. i\u0027ve never seen a serious injury there and theres no ego like you find at alot of places where people get hurt and feel like they ahve to keep training to prove something. everyone is really careful not to hurt each other. you could just as well be with these people at a bar or bbq as be at the gym rolling around on the ground trying to choke each other. its a great atmosphere to train in.",

      "comment": "Clockwork BJJ is a rare gem among the Jiu Jitsu schools, where friendly and ego-free atmosphere combines with high-quality training and instructions.  The school offers a variety of classes that are designed to accommodate all levels of practitioners - from the very beginners to the competing athletes.  Josh\u0027s teaching method is very structured and through-through, introducing continuity to the learning process.  Techniques and positions are explained in detail and linked together, helping to understand the flow of transitions and options. All of the instructors are highly accommodating, and there\u0027s an overall emphasis on having fun, while learning and making progress.  It\u0027s a school where everyone can find something for themselves to focus on, improve and enjoy.",

The first thing that I noticed about Clockwork and its head instructor, Josh Griffiths is the welcoming vibe. The atmosphere at Clockwork is fun and relaxed. People are having fun, learning Jiu Jitsu, and being fit. Its a cool place, different than what I had originally imagined a \"martial arts\" school to be.\n\nThe level of instruction is in depth and Josh breaks down concepts and moves so anyone can do them. I\u0027m very pleased with the level of progression my body and my Jiu Jitsu has had after training at Clockwork for some time. After training for awhile my only regret is that I hesitated so long to start Jiu Jitsu. Actually going down to the gym and trying it out was one of the best decisions I made.",

I have been there for 3 months already and can\u0027t even start to explain how awesome of a place it is, all the people i train with weather a white belt, black belt or anything in btw have been awesome and super help no one in the place is beyond approach everyone is so super helpful and willing to put themselves out there to make you better. Josh is an amazing and attentive instructor who is willing to help you in any way possible to make your jui jitsu better. This is a great school with no b.s. you get to class and your straight into training, none of that other non sense of aerobics or what have you for 20 mins then only 40 mins of learning... you get it from start to finish. And the schedule is amazing, classes as early as 7am and up to 8pm now... This is the place to be... I wouldn\u0027t want to train any where else. Check it out you won\u0027t wanna go any where else.

      "comment": "I\u0027ve had a great experience at Clockwork over the past 7 months or so. I went into it with no BJJ or grappling experience, unsure of what to expect. Sebastien, one of the instructors, spent 45 minutes showing me some techniques, and answered any questions I had.\n\nThe classes are great. There are white-belt-only classes most days, which have a set curriculum for beginners. Yet many white belts stay for the mixed classes as well, where folks from higher belts are welcoming and willing to work with less experienced folks. Classes will go over the same (or closely related) techniques for a few weeks in a row, which is really effective for learning due to the repetition (versus doing a different thing every day). They\u0027ve also just started blue belt classes, although I\u0027m not at that level yet so I can\u0027t speak to it.\n\nThe instructors are great at breaking down techniques into different segments, and explaining not just how but why something works. This is important in BJJ in terms of gaining an understanding of the mechanics involved...it\u0027s much easier to successfully apply a technique while rolling if you understand what makes it work (the pressure here, the leverage there) and mistakes to avoid.\n\nI\u0027ve found that the instructors (and students) take BJJ very seriously, which is great, but that there is space for a variety of types of students. So if you want to train 5 times a week, twice a day, and get really good, there are people who perform at a high level, and a lot of the students compete. But if you have a busy schedule or it\u0027s more of a casual hobby or a form of exercise for you, it\u0027s still a place to train...you aren\u0027t treated poorly as a result, and the stronger folks aren\u0027t going to break your neck when you roll with them.\n\nFinally, Josh, the owner and head instructor, and the other instructors are very knowledgeable, articulate, effective teachers, and nice people. They and the people who train at Clockwork are very friendly and welcoming. Also, while most students are men (I think that\u0027s true of martial arts in general), there are a number of women who train at Clockwork, including one of the black belt instructors, and from what I can tell (as a man, so of course take it with a grain of salt) it seems like a woman-friendly place.\n\nI\u0027m really happy with my experience at Clockwork. The only thing I\u0027d say is that if you\u0027re mostly looking to train no gi, this might not be the best place for you, since most classes are gi (there are multiple no gi sessions, but it\u0027s not every day).",

      "comment": "clockwork is hands-down the best bjj school that i have been to. it is somehow simultaneously the friendliest, smartest, ego-free school that is also full of the best jits players that i have encountered. here is a short list of rad things about clockwork (many of which are echoed in the other reviews):\n\n- white belt only classes, so that you can learn the fundamentals without getting smashed by some big blue belt who wants to work on his kimuras or north south control. you can learn at good pace with other beginners.\n\n- tons of clean mat space in a beautiful 2nd floor location with lots of natural light. the school is really attractive and every photo taken in it looks great (i.e. good for instagramming (just kidding)). you can usually find room for a roll and people are very conscious of their space.\n\n- a large amount of students of varying skill levels and builds. this is really important! if you are a small person you can find another small person of your skill level consistently. if you want to roll with big, technical guys, clockwork has those too!\n\n- josh griffiths is a fantastic teacher. he is totally generous with his knowledge, which is deep and really technical. he has lots of nuances when it comes to particular moves that really help pull off a particular submission or sweep. you can tell these nuances aren\u0027t from some kind of doctrine, but are from hard won experience and mat time. he is an experienced, decorated competitor who is great at helping his students achieve success at competition as well! which brings me to my last point...\n\n- the overall vibe. basically the heart of what makes clockwork the best gym is how friendly, fun, and non-meatheadish the vibe is. josh, as the lead instructor, sets a tone of dedicated bjj practice, but tempered with a lot of good vibes and humor. the advanced students are also really really helpful and can typically give you pointers on almost any part of your game. it is a casual, positive, and encouraging place.\n\ni can\u0027t say enough good things about clockwork! if you\u0027ve ever considered training bjj, start here.",

He has created a great ego-less atmosphere that is conducive to learning and growing. There\u0027s no pressure at clockwork, you can make of it what you want...",

All I\u0027ll say is that I\u0027ve been training for 4+ years, I\u0027m in great shape, and I train 5 days/week. I don\u0027t do this because I\u0027m some pillar of discipline. I do it because Clockwork is clean, the Jiu Jitsu instruction is top-notch, and the people are some of the coolest I\u0027ve ever met. So, come check it out. Best-case scenario? You become an athletic assassin, win every tournament, and forego a fitness modeling career to run for President. Worst-case scenario? You show up, meet some good-looking strangers, overhear some funny jokes, and learn about an amazing sport. Let\u0027s just agree it\u0027s a win-win!",

      "comment": "I visited a half-dozen academies in Manhattan before settling on Clockwork. I compared the schools on six categories and Clockwork won in almost every category.\n\nAmbiance\nThe first thing that struck me about Clockwork is the great ambiance. They have a second floor gym, with huge windows on one end. The entire school is one nice long room, with a welcoming seating area at the entrance by the windows. From there, while you are taking off your shoes and chatting, you can see the rest of the students training. You walk past everyone (along the side of the mats) on your way to the showers at the back, which gives you a chance to see what\u0027s going on up close, and say hello to people you know. The whole layout can be summed up as \"friendly, open, and welcoming\". Compared to other gyms I visited, which often feel like dungeons or basements, Clockwork stands out.\n\nAttitude\nThe next thing that struck me is the attitude. BJJ is inexorably linked to MMA, and a lot of people who train in it seem to have an attitude that they\u0027re going to crush their opponents, even if it\u0027s just their training partners. At some gyms, this left me feeling like I was fending for myself in a dog-eat-dog culture, where I\u0027d have to claw my way to each belt ranking. Clockwork, on the other hand, seems to specifically promote more of a team feeling even from day one as a white belt. You feel like you\u0027re training with friends, who share their best tips and tricks (rather than trying to keep them secret so they can \"win\" during training). If you ask someone to roll lightly, they actually do. It makes it so students can train even with light injuries because they know their training partners will respect the injury. Furthermore, the school has no rigid rules the some schools have. You can ask a higher belt to roll, you can adjust your gi on the mat, and you\u0027re on a first-name basis with the instructors.\n\nStructure\nAt nearly every other school I visited, the instructors seemed to choose \"random move of the day\" to teach. Clockwork uses a different model: they focus each week on a particular move, and they work on that move and drill it for the entire week to give you a chance to master it. I like this because it means I can come in each day knowing what to expect, and I can give thought outside of class to the move and really nail down the details of it to ensure it\u0027s polished. For someone who thinks about BJJ as more than just a workout, this is a great way to train.\n\nCleanliness\nOn my first visit, I was struck by how clean and stink-free the gym was (as opposed to some of the other gyms I visited where the smell of sweat hit me in the face as soon as I entered the building lobby). What really made Clockwork stand out was the attention to detail. For example, it was the only gym where I was loaned a pair of sandals to use when entering the bathroom. The place is just CLEAN.\n\nWarmup\nClockwork takes a very cool approach to warmups: they have you drill purely BJJ moves! Most schools have you run around the mats in circles to get warmed up, then do shrimping and falling exercises. Clockwork keeps the shrimping exercises, but replaces the running with additional relevant warmup moves such as knee passes and side control switching, etc. You definitely break a sweat doing it, and at the same time you get used to common movements in BJJ.\n\nDistance\nClockwork wasn\u0027t the closest gym to me (in fact, one of the others is just 100 yards from my apartment). But it is accessible from both my home and office by two train lines and was worth the extra travel time to me.\n\nOverall, I\u0027m very happy to have found Clockwork and look forward to many more years of training!",

From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and comfortable. It\u0027s a boutique gym with a tight knit, friendly and very supportive community.\nThe instructors are very attentive and incredibly supportive, which made my transition into the sport much smoother.\nThe beginner classes and bootcamps are well-structured and focused on building a strong foundation, which is exactly what I was looking for. The instructors take the time to explain each technique thoroughly and are always available to answer questions.\nIn addition, Clockwork has a big female community that was very important for me as a female that is new to martial arts.\nOverall, my experience at Clockwork has been fantastic, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to start their Brazilian Jiu Jitsu journey. It\u0027s a great place to learn, feel empowered and make new friends!",

      "comment": "LOVE IT \u0026 HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!! Both of my sons (age 5 and 8) have really developed an interest in Jiu Jitsu, since they started taking classes at Clockwork Jiu Jitsu. They have taken other martial arts classes prior (ie: judo, boxing, taekwondo), but this is by far their favorite! The instructors are ALL amazing! Their technique is impecable, so much so that they are able to teach it to adults AND children. As a mother, daughter and teacher, I am able to recognize a GOOD children’s teacher when I see one. A big part of martial arts that they are able to teach by example is respect, discipline and dedication. They LISTEN to their students, while being firm. They are compassionate and playful, while also being disciplined and stern. It’s a lost art! Clockwork is a great place for children to learn self defense, discipline, respect and confidence!!!! Anthony and Ray, you guys are the best!",

I am option C and have nothing but great things to say about Clockwork. The mats and space are well taken care of, including the mats on the wall. The instruction by Professor Josh was efficient, precise and accurate. He has an excellent way of conveying the information that is easy to digest and implement right away. The community of grapplers are friendly and proficient, while also maintaining good sportsmanship and in-check egos. I visited as a brown belt and was greeted warmly by the team. The entire experience was top notch and I highly recommend it for anyone looking to drop in. I have trained at several gyms across the country and world and had a great time at Clockwork BJJ. I took the no gi and gi classes in the middle of the day.",

It was one of the best decisions I\u0027ve ever made. It\u0027s such an easy environment to learn and grow. It\u0027s the type of gym I can see myself still training at a decade from now. The instructors are meticulous about their craft, very approachable, and inspire a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The white belt classes are perfectly suited for complete beginners. Jiu-jitsu can be a lot to take in at first, and I think many people quit early simply because they get overwhelmed and have no idea how to digest it all. The white belt classes do a great job of introducing you to the sport by only focusing on two techniques each week. That way you can really take your time to explore the techniques and concepts before moving on to the advanced classes. I highly recommend this place to practitioners of all levels.",

Well, his confidence in the physical department skyrocketed and now he\u0027s considered an assertive kid. Clockwork is an awesome safe space to say the least. Staff is great and it\u0027s a very clean place too.  I highly recommend.",

      "comment": "What a fantastic school. As a visitor, I was struck by the amount of individual attention afforded not only by Josh but by other higher-level belts in attendance. This pays off enormously not just in tracking student progress, but in how each technique is drilled - if you\u0027re doing it wrong, the head instructor will catch it and help you. At other places, there is just too much going on for that to happen because the teacher to student ratio is too high. And like their website says, this is an ego-free community, which makes it all about learning. If you have the chance to train here, congratulations!",

Neighborhood quality as the kids classes were finishing up when I arrived.  Locker room is nothing special. I’m not sure it fits my schedule yet but I’d recommend this place if it fits yours.  I’m sure this school will be part of my future.",

Can’t say enough about the teaching and generosity of the instructors and other members. They made a relatively inexperienced white belt feel at home and comfortable. Highly recommend for all skill levels.",
